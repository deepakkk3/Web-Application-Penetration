# SQL-I or (Structured query language) Injection.

# What Is SQL Injection .?
     
      SQL Injection, Also Known As SQLI,Is A Common Attack Vector That Uses Malicious SQL Code For Backend Database 
      Manipulation To Access Information That Was Not Intended To Be Displayed.This Information May Include Any Number
      Of Items, Including Sensitive Company Data, User Lists Or Private Customer Details.

## Types Of SQL Injections.
 
    SQL Injection Can Be Classified Into Three Major Categories – In-band SQLi, Inferential (Blind ) SQLi  & 
    Out -Of-Band SQLi.

## In-band SQLi (Classic SQLi) 
  
    The Attacker Uses The Same Channel Of Communication To Launch Their Attacks And To Gather Their Results. 
    In-band SQLi’s Simplicity And Efficiency Make It One Of The Most Common Types Of SQLi Attack.
    There Are Two Sub-Variations Of This Method:-
      
  •  Error-based SQLi—the attacker performs actions that cause the database to produce error messages. 
     The attacker can potentially use the data provided by these error messages to gather information
     about the structure of the database.
    
  •  Union-Based SQLi—this technique takes advantage of the UNION SQL operator, which fuses multiple select 
     Statements generated By The Database To Get A Single HTTP Response.This Response May Contain Data  
     That Can Be Leveraged By The Attacker.
      
## Inferential (Blind) SQLi.
 
     The Attacker Sends Data Payloads To The Server And Observes The Response And Behavior Of The Server To 
     Learn More About It's Structure.This Method Is Called Blind SQLi Because The Data Is Not Transferred From
     The Website Database To The Attacker,thus the attacker cannot See Information About The Attack In-Band.
    
     Blind SQL Injections Rely On The Response And Behavioral Patterns Of The Server So They Are Typically Slower
     To Execute But May Be Just As Harmful.Blind SQL Injections Can Be Classified As Follows:-
    
  •  Boolean — That Attacker Sends A SQL Query To The Database Prompting The Application To Return A Result. 
     The result will vary depending on whether the query is true or false. Based on the result, the information within the HTTP
     response will modify or stay unchanged.The attacker Can Then Work Out If The Message Generated A True Or False Result.
     
   • Time-based—attacker Sends A SQL Query To The Database, Which Makes The Database Wait (For A Period In Seconds) 
     Before It Can React.The Attacker Can See From The Time The Database Takes To Respond, Whether A Query Is True Or False.
     Based On The Result, An HTTP Response Will Be Generated Instantly Or After A Waiting Period. The Attacker Can Thus Work
     Out If The Message They Used Returned True Or False, Without Relying On Data From The Database.
     
## Out-of-band SQLi   
     
     The attacker can only carry out this form of attack when certain  features are enabled on the database server used by 
     the web application. This form of attack is primarily used as an alternative to the in-band  and inferential SQLi techniques. 

     Out-Of-Band SQLi Is Performed When The Attacker Can't Use The Same Channel To Launch The Attack And Gather Information, 
     Or When A Server Is Too Slow Or Unstable For These Actions To Be Performed. These Techniques Count On The Capacity Of The Server
     To Create DNS Or HTTP Requests To Transfer Data To An Attacker.
