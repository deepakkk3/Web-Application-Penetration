SQL-I or (Structured query language) Injection.

1:- what is SQL Injection .?
     
     # SQL injection, also known as SQLI, is a common attack vector that uses malicious SQL code for backend database manipulation to access information that was    not intended  to be displayed.This information may include any number of items, including sensitive company data, user lists or private customer details.

2:- Types of SQL Injections.
 
    # SQL Injection Can Be Classified Into Three Major Categories – In-band SQLi, Inferential (Blind ) SQLi  & Out -Of-Band SQLi.

>In-band SQLi (Classic SQLi) 
  
    The attacker uses the same channel of communication to launch their  attacks and to gather their results. In-band SQLi’s simplicity 
      and efficiency make it one of the most common types of SQLi attack. There  are two sub-variations of this method:-
      
     • Error-based SQLi—the attacker performs actions that cause the database to produce error messages. 
        The attacker can potentially use the data provided by these error messages to gather information
         about the structure of the database.

    • Union-based SQLi—this technique takes advantage of the UNION SQL operator, which fuses multiple select statements 
      generated by the database to get a single HTTP response.This response may contain data that can be leveraged by the attacker.
      
 >Inferential (Blind) SQLi.
 
     The attacker sends data payloads to the server and observes the  response and behavior of the server to learn more about its structure.  
     This Method Is Called Blind SQLi Because The Data Is Not Transferred From The Website Database To The Attacker,thus the attacker cannot 
      See Information About The Attack In-Band.

    Blind SQL Injections Rely On The Response And Behavioral Patterns Of The Server So They Are Typically Slower To Execute But May Be Just As Harmful. 
      Blind SQL Injections Can Be Classified As Follows:-
    
     • Boolean — That Attacker Sends A SQL Query To The Database Prompting The Application To Return A Result. 
       The result will vary depending on whether the query is true or false. Based on the result, the information within the HTTP
       response will modify or stay unchanged.The attacker Can Then Work Out If The Message Generated A True Or False Result.

    • Time-based—attacker Sends A SQL Query To The Database, Which Makes The Database Wait (For A Period In Seconds) Before It Can React.
    The Attacker Can See From The Time The Database Takes To Respond, Whether A Query Is True Or False. Based On The Result, An HTTP 
    Response Will Be Generated Instantly Or After A Waiting Period. The Attacker Can Thus Work Out If The Message They Used Returned True Or False,                   Without Relying On Data From The Database.
     
   >Out-of-band SQLi   
     
     The attacker can only carry out this form of attack when certain  features are enabled on the database server used by the web application. 
     This form of attack is primarily used as an alternative to the in-band  and inferential SQLi techniques. 

    Out-Of-Band SQLi Is Performed When The Attacker Can't Use The Same Channel To Launch The Attack And Gather Information, Or When A Server Is
    Too Slow Or Unstable For These Actions To Be Performed. These Techniques Count On The Capacity Of The Server To Create DNS Or HTTP Requests 
    To Transfer Data To An Attacker.
